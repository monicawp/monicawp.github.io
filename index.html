                    <p>
                        This is one of the very first C# console applications I developed in my career. The objective was to code an ATM like application that allows a user to deposit, withdraw, and view their account balances.
                        Using C# with three derives classes inheriting from the base class

                    <p>
                        Wardrobe is another MVC web application that helps manage a user's closet. Prompting the user to input clothing and view the details and photo of each.
                        This is the first project I had used a database first approach using SQL.
                        I found it extrememly useful to plan out the database on paper first to ensure no bugs or mistakes.
                        This includes four tables in SQL that are then used in Visual Studio MVC where it was styled to my liking.
